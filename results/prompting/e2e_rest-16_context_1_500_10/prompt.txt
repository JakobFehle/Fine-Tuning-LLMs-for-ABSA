b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nService is average.\nOutput:\n[("Service", NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nWe had a very nice time.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nDumbfoundingly Poor\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI have been to Roth\'s twice and both times were very disappointing.\nOutput:\n[("Roth\'s", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGreat food, amazing service, this place is a class act.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE), ("place", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAll the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nConsequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did\'nt feel like finishing them.\nOutput:\n[("burgers", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThey were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWhat more can you ask for?\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.\nOutput:\n[("restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nI have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good. \n\n### Output:\n'
