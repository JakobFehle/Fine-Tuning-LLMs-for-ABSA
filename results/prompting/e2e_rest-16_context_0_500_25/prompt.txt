b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nBest meal in a long time!\nOutput:\n[("meal", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe left, never to return.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were then shooed inside.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nStepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York!\nOutput:\n[("Casa La Femme", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI heartily recommend.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nYou cannot go wrong with this place.\nOutput:\n[("place", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI recieved prompt service with a smile.\nOutput:\n[("service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food tasted very good.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nYou will not be disapointed at all.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nshort and sweet \xe2\x80\x93 seating is great:it\'s romantic,cozy and private.\nOutput:\n[("seating", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.\nOutput:\n[("Thai food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSo, if you\'re walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who\'s going to be seating you first...\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.\nOutput:\n[("Service", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe hot dogs are top notch, and they\'re Slamwich is amazing!\nOutput:\n[("hot dogs", POSITIVE), ("Slamwich", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nA beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night.\nOutput:\n[("Egyptian restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI\'ve waited over one hour for food.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThere was a small wait, but shorter than I expected.\nOutput:\n[("wait", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.\nOutput:\n[("entree", NEGATIVE), ("entree", NEGATIVE), ("dessert", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nA weakness is the chicken in the salads.\nOutput:\n[("chicken in the salads", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.\nOutput:\n[("foods", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWill never be back.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nHad an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.\nOutput:\n[("Casa la Femme", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSauce was watery and the food didn\'t have much flavor.\nOutput:\n[("Sauce", NEGATIVE), ("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nWent on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great! \n\n### Output:\n'
