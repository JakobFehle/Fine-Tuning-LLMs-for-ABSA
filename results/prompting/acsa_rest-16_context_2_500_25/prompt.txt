Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant.
