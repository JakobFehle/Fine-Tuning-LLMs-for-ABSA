b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nHad an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.\nOutput:\n[("Casa la Femme", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nStepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York!\nOutput:\n[("Casa La Femme", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.\nOutput:\n[("Thai food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we\'ve ever had!! \nOutput:\n[("baked clams octopus", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI heartily recommend.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nTheir tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.\nOutput:\n[("tuna tartar appetizer", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI recieved prompt service with a smile.\nOutput:\n[("service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nYou must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.\nOutput:\n[("crabmeat lasagna", POSITIVE), ("chocolate bread pudding", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nYou will not be disapointed at all.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nshort and sweet \xe2\x80\x93 seating is great:it\'s romantic,cozy and private.\nOutput:\n[("seating", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSave yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSo, if you\'re walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who\'s going to be seating you first...\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.\nOutput:\n[("service", POSITIVE), ("staff", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.\nOutput:\n[("Service", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe hot dogs are top notch, and they\'re Slamwich is amazing!\nOutput:\n[("hot dogs", POSITIVE), ("Slamwich", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food tasted very good.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI must give it Yon out of Yon stars!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThere was a small wait, but shorter than I expected.\nOutput:\n[("wait", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.\nOutput:\n[("entree", NEGATIVE), ("entree", NEGATIVE), ("dessert", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nA weakness is the chicken in the salads.\nOutput:\n[("chicken in the salads", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSauce was watery and the food didn\'t have much flavor.\nOutput:\n[("Sauce", NEGATIVE), ("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWill never be back.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWhen the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService is top notch.\nOutput:\n[("Service", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nJudging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer. \n\n### Output:\n'
