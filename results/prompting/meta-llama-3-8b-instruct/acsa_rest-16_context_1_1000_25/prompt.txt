b"### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant. DRINKS#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the drinks, DRINKS#QUALITY refers to the quality of the drinks and DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of drinks and the variety of the drinks menu. FOOD#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the food, FOOD#QUALITY refers to the quality of the food and FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of food and the variety of the food menu.

RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nI had the Lamb special which was perfect.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#PRICES, NEGATIVE), (RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSpreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#PRICES, NEGATIVE), (FOOD#PRICES, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE), (RESTAURANT#PRICES, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe Yellowtail was particularly good as well.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (DRINKS#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were less than impressed.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.\nOutput:\n[(DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE), (FOOD#PRICES, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\neveryone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAs many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nWe will be back.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nLLOOVVE THIS PLACE.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAlso very inexpensive.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#PRICES, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\n(The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!)\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nit was really good pizza.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe only downside... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nFood is great.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMy six year old loved it.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nI have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good. \n\n### Output:\n"
