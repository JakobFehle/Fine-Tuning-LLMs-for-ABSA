b'[("lunch buffet", POSITIVE)]  ### Correct output\n### Explanation:\nThe sentence expresses a positive sentiment towards the "lunch buffet". The phrase "is deff worth it" implies that the lunch buffet is worth the expense, which is a positive opinion. The phrase "is expensive" is a negative statement, but it is not directed towards the "lunch buffet" itself, but rather towards the price. Therefore, the sentiment polarity is POSITIVE. The opinion target phrase is "lunch buffet".  ### END OF EXPLANATION'
