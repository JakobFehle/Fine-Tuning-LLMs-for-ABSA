b'Lets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don\'t.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a negative sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a negative sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "bland" and also towards the phrase "food" (implied). \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuples: [("food", NEGATIVE), ("bland", NEGATIVE)]'
