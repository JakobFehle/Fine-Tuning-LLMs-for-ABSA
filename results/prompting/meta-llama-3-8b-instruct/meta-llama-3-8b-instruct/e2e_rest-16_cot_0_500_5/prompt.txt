b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nIf you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a negative sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a negative sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "food".. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThey are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a negative sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: Even though sentiment is expressed in the text, it is not directed towards an explicit opinion target. We thus assign its phrase the value "NULL". \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSingle Worst Restaurant in Manhattan\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a negative sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a negative sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "Restaurant".. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("Restaurant", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThere\'s nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "There\'s nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a positive sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: Even though sentiment is expressed in the text, it is not directed towards an explicit opinion target. We thus assign its phrase the value "NULL". \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a positive sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a positive sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "sashimi amuse bouche".. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("sashimi amuse bouche", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nWent on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great! \n\n### Output:\n'
