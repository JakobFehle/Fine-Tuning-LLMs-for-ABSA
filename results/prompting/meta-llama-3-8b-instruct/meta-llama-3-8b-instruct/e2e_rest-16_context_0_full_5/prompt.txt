b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nWhich of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!\nOutput:\n[("terrace", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.\nOutput:\n[("pear torte", POSITIVE), ("staff", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nfood was luke warm.\nOutput:\n[("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it.\nOutput:\n[("Cypriot restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThe food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny. \n\n### Output:\n'
