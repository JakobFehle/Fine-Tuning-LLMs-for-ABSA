b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.\nOutput:\n[("waiter", POSITIVE), ("food", POSITIVE), ("views of the city", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOn that scale, it\'s a world-beater.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).\nOutput:\n[("manager", POSITIVE), ("manager", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThank you everyone at Water\'s Edge.\nOutput:\n[("Water\'s Edge", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.\nOutput:\n[("staff", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nit\'s delicious!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)\nOutput:\n[("fit-out", POSITIVE), ("furnishings", POSITIVE), ("wine list", POSITIVE), ("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt was pretty inexpensive too.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were then shooed inside.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSave yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThe food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny. \n\n### Output:\n'
