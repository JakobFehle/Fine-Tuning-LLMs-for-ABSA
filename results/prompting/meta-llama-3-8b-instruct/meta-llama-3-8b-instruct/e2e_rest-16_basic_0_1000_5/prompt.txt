b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE] expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL".\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.\nOutput:\n[("waiter", POSITIVE), ("food", POSITIVE), ("views of the city", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOn that scale, it\'s a world-beater.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).\nOutput:\n[("manager", POSITIVE), ("manager", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThank you everyone at Water\'s Edge.\nOutput:\n[("Water\'s Edge", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.\nOutput:\n[("staff", NEGATIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThe food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny. \n\n### Output:\n'
