b"### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant. DRINKS#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the drinks, DRINKS#QUALITY refers to the quality of the drinks and DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of drinks and the variety of the drinks menu. FOOD#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the food, FOOD#QUALITY refers to the quality of the food and FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of food and the variety of the food menu. LOCATION#GENERAL refers the the location of the restaurant. SERVICE#GENERAL includes ratings on the service in general, the attitude of the staff, waiting times or other services such as takeaway. RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOn that scale, it's a world-beater.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThank you everyone at Water's Edge.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nit's delicious!\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt was pretty inexpensive too.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#PRICES, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were then shooed inside.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSave yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nPersonal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMy chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWhen asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently \nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAnd amazingly cheap.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#PRICES, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI pray it stays open forever.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nToo bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI recieved prompt service with a smile.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGo there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nBut for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAlso very inexpensive.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#PRICES, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nLLOOVVE THIS PLACE.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nNever got an explanation as to what was going on.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nVolare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThe food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny. \n\n### Output:\n"
