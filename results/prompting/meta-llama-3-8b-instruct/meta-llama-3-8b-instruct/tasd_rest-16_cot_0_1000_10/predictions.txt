b'Lets do this step by step. We would like to extract all aspect-sentiment-phrase-triples from the following sentence: "Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don\'t.". First, we identify the aspect addressed in the sentence and its corresponding phrase: The aspect FOOD#QUALITY is referenced with the phrase "food". Next, we determine the sentiment expressed towards this aspect: The aspect FOOD#QUALITY is mentioned negatively in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following aspect-sentiment-phrase-triple: [(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE, "food")]'
b'[(LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE, "the river in Weehawken"), (RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE, "the chart house")]'
b'[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, "NULL")]'
b'[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE, "NULL"), (FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE, "NULL")]\n### Explanation:\nThe sentence expresses a negative sentiment towards the quality of the pizza, implying that the use of fancy ingredients is not enough to make a good pizza. The aspect FOOD#QUALITY is mentioned negatively in the text. The phrase "NULL" is assigned to this aspect because the sentence does not explicitly mention the aspect phrase. The same sentiment is expressed towards the aspect FOOD#QUALITY again, so another triple is added to the output. '
