b'[("Fish", POSITIVE), ("this place", POSITIVE)]  ### Correct output\n### Explanation:\nThe sentence expresses a positive sentiment towards "Fish" and "this place". The phrase "I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended" implies that the speaker is glad that the trip ended at this place, which is the target of the positive sentiment. The phrase "it was so great" also expresses a positive sentiment towards the place. The phrase "Went on a 3 day oyster binge" is a neutral statement and does not express a sentiment towards any target. The phrase "with Fish bringing up the closing" is a neutral statement that mentions "Fish" but does not express a sentiment towards "Fish". Therefore, the output is [("Fish", POSITIVE), ("this place", POSITIVE)].  ### END OF EXPLANATION'
