b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nWhich of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a negative sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: Even though sentiment is expressed in the text, it is not directed towards an explicit opinion target. We thus assign its phrase the value "NULL". \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a positive sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a positive sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "terrace".. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("terrace", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.". First, we identify all sentiments expressed in the sentence: The sentence contains positive and negative sentiment. Then, we determine the opinion targets of the expressed sentiments: positive sentiment is directed towards "pear torte" and negative sentiment is directed towards "staff" in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuples: [("pear torte", POSITIVE), ("staff", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nfood was luke warm.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "food was luke warm.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a negative sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a negative sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "food".. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a positive sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a positive sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "Cypriot restaurant".. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("Cypriot restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe will be back.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "We will be back.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a positive sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: Even though sentiment is expressed in the text, it is not directed towards an explicit opinion target. We thus assign its phrase the value "NULL". \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.". First, we identify all sentiments expressed in the sentence: The sentence contains positive and positive sentiment. Then, we determine the opinion targets of the expressed sentiments: positive sentiment is directed towards "veal" and positive sentiment is directed towards "mushrooms" in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuples: [("veal", POSITIVE), ("mushrooms", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI really loved the different and inovated touch that\'s the cheff gives to the food.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "I really loved the different and inovated touch that\'s the cheff gives to the food.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a positive sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a positive sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "cheff".. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("cheff", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWorth the trip from Manhattan.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "Worth the trip from Manhattan.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a positive sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: Even though sentiment is expressed in the text, it is not directed towards an explicit opinion target. We thus assign its phrase the value "NULL". \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI take all my NYC guests to VT\'s.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "I take all my NYC guests to VT\'s.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a positive sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a positive sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "VT\'s".. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("VT\'s", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThe food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny. \n\n### Output:\n'
