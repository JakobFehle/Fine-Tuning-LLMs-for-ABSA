b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant. DRINKS#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the drinks, DRINKS#QUALITY refers to the quality of the drinks and DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of drinks and the variety of the drinks menu. FOOD#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the food, FOOD#QUALITY refers to the quality of the food and FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of food and the variety of the food menu. LOCATION#GENERAL refers the the location of the restaurant. SERVICE#GENERAL includes ratings on the service in general, the attitude of the staff, waiting times or other services such as takeaway. RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all aspect-sentiment-pairs from the following sentence: "The waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.". First, we identify all aspects addressed in the sentence: SERVICE#GENERAL, FOOD#QUALITY and LOCATION#GENERAL. Next, we determine the sentiment expressed towards these aspects: The aspect SERVICE#GENERAL is referenced positively, the aspect FOOD#QUALITY is referenced positively and the aspect LOCATION#GENERAL is referenced positively in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following aspect-sentiment-pairs: [(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOn that scale, it\'s a world-beater.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all aspect-sentiment-pairs from the following sentence: "On that scale, it\'s a world-beater.". First, we identify the aspect addressed in the sentence: RESTAURANT#GENERAL. Next, we determine the sentiment expressed towards this aspect: The aspect RESTAURANT#GENERAL is referenced negatively in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following aspect-sentiment-pair: [(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step.
