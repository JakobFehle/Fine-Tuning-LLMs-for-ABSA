b'Lets do this step by step.

First, we identify the aspect addressed in the sentence and its corresponding phrase: The aspect FOOD is referenced with the phrase "Chuck Flap Steaks". Next, we determine the sentiment expressed towards this aspect: The aspect FOOD is mentioned negatively in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following aspect-sentiment-phrase-triple: [(FOOD, NEGATIVE, "Chuck Flap Steaks")]'
