b'[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE, "it"), (FOOD#GENERAL, POSITIVE, "it"), (LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE, "it")]  # or any other valid combination of aspect, sentiment, and phrase\n### Explanation:\nThe sentence is talking about a great experience at a restaurant. The aspect FOOD#QUALITY is mentioned positively with the phrase "it". The aspect FOOD#GENERAL is also mentioned positively with the phrase "it". The aspect LOCATION#GENERAL is also mentioned positively with the phrase "it". The sentiment is positive for all three aspects. '

b'Lets do this step by step. We would like to extract all aspect-sentiment-phrase-triples from the following sentence: "Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don\'t.". First, we identify the aspect addressed in the sentence and its corresponding phrase: The aspect FOOD#QUALITY is referenced with the phrase "food". Next, we determine the sentiment expressed towards this aspect: The aspect FOOD#QUALITY is mentioned negatively in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following aspect-sentiment-phrase-triple: [(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE, "food")]'

b'Lets do this step by step. We would like to extract all aspect-sentiment-phrase-triples from the following sentence: "Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $. ". First, we identify the aspect addressed in the sentence and its corresponding phrase: The aspect SERVICE#GENERAL is inferred from the context of the sentence and is therefore referenced without a phrase. We thus assign its phrase the value "NULL". Next, we determine the sentiment expressed towards this aspect: The aspect SERVICE#GENERAL is mentioned negatively in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following aspect-sentiment-phrase-triple: [(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, "NULL")]'
