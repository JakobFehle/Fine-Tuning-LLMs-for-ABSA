b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nIf you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.\nOutput:\n[("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThey are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSingle Worst Restaurant in Manhattan\nOutput:\n[("Restaurant", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThere\'s nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.\nOutput:\n[("sashimi amuse bouche", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService was wonderful;\nOutput:\n[("Service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGreat atmoshere and worth every bit.\nOutput:\n[("atmoshere", POSITIVE), ("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAlways good drinks and service is pretty good;\nOutput:\n[("drinks", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nTerrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.\nOutput:\n[("management", NEGATIVE), ("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOh, and there\'s hookah.\nOutput:\n[("hookah", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nBut too far east!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nHis response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.\nOutput:\n[("portions", NEGATIVE), ("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIf you\'re into being lost when you\'re just five feet from your table then hey, that\'s a good thing.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\ndelicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE), ("food", POSITIVE), ("outdoor atmosphere", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe will be back.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGreat Indian food\nOutput:\n[("Indian food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.\nOutput:\n[("place", NEGATIVE), ("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.\nOutput:\n[("staff", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nRaymond the bartender rocks!\nOutput:\n[("Raymond", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food was excellent as well as service, however, I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE), ("The Four Seasons", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nA quintessential slice of NYC pizza.\nOutput:\n[("slice of NYC pizza", NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nmy favorite place lol\nOutput:\n[("place", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nWent on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great! \n\n### Output:\n'
