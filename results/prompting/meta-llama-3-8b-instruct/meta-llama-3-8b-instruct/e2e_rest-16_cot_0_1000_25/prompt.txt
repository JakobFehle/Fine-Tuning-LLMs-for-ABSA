b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "The waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.". First, we identify all sentiments expressed in the sentence: The sentence contains positive, positive and positive sentiments. Then, we determine the opinion targets of the expressed sentiments: positive sentiment is directed towards "waiter", positive sentiment is directed towards "food" and positive sentiment is directed towards "views of the city". \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuples: [("waiter", POSITIVE), ("food", POSITIVE), ("views of the city", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOn that scale, it\'s a world-beater.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "On that scale, it\'s a world-beater.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a negative sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: Even though sentiment is expressed in the text, it is not directed towards an explicit opinion target. We thus assign its phrase the value "NULL". \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).". First, we identify all sentiments expressed in the sentence: The sentence contains positive and negative sentiment. Then, we determine the opinion targets of the expressed sentiments: positive sentiment is directed towards "manager" and negative sentiment is directed towards "manager" in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuples: [("manager", POSITIVE), ("manager", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThank you everyone at Water\'s Edge.\nOutput:\nLets do this step by step.
