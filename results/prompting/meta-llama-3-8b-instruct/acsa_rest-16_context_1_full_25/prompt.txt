b"### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant. DRINKS#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the drinks, DRINKS#QUALITY refers to the quality of the drinks and DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of drinks and the variety of the drinks menu. FOOD#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the food, FOOD#QUALITY refers to the quality of the food and FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of food and the variety of the food menu. LOCATION#GENERAL refers the the location of the restaurant. SERVICE#GENERAL includes ratings on the service in general, the attitude of the staff, waiting times or other services such as takeaway. RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt's a small cute restaurant.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nFood-awesome.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe had a very nice time.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nShe was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMyagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE), (RESTAURANT#PRICES, NEGATIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMy six year old loved it.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nChennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nTheir bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe had half/half pizza, mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza!\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nReliable, Fresh Sushi\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nFood was good not great not worth the wait or another visit\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEUTRAL), (RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSimply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#PRICES, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\ntoo large for just two people but nothing was left.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, NEUTRAL), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nToo bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nBut, they were too big for the bun.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nUnique apppetizers.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nskip dessert.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWas surprisingly disappointed.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nI have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good. \n\n### Output:\n"
