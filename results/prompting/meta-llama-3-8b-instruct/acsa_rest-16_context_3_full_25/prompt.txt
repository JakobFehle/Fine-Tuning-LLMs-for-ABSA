b"### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant. DRINKS#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the drinks, DRINKS#QUALITY refers to the quality of the drinks and DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of drinks and the variety of the drinks menu. FOOD#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the food, FOOD#QUALITY refers to the quality of the food and FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of food and the variety of the food menu.

RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nI go out to eat and like my courses, servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nFood-awesome.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nShe was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMyagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting, without it trying to be that.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE), (RESTAURANT#PRICES, NEGATIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt is simply amazing.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nChennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nToons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGross food \xe2\x80\x93 Wow-\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService is not what you are coming here for...\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSimply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#PRICES, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nThey have it all -- great price, food, and service.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (RESTAURANT#PRICES, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nToo bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nBut, they were too big for the bun.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIf you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nskip dessert.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWas surprisingly disappointed.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nFor the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan. \n\n### Output:\n"
