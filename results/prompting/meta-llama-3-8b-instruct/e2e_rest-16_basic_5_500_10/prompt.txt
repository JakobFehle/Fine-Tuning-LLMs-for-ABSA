b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE] expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL".\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nWe waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.\nOutput:\n[("martinis", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.\nOutput:\n[("atmosphere", NEGATIVE), ("scheme of mirrors", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don\xe2\x80\x99t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!\nOutput:\n[("modern Japanese brasserie", POSITIVE), ("modern Japanese brasserie", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nthe only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish. \nOutput:\n[("soy sauce", NEGATIVE), ("rice", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt\'s just average, just shredded, no seasoning on it.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food is good.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.\nOutput:\n[("entree", NEGATIVE), ("entree", NEGATIVE), ("dessert", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI definitely wouldn\'t go back.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.\nOutput:\n[("customer service", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOverall, excellent restaurant!\nOutput:\n[("restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThey never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table. \n\n### Output:\n'
