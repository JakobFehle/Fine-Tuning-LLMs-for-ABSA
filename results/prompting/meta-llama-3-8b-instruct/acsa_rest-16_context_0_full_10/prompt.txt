b"### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant. DRINKS#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the drinks, DRINKS#QUALITY refers to the quality of the drinks and DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of drinks and the variety of the drinks menu. FOOD#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the food, FOOD#QUALITY refers to the quality of the food and FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of food and the variety of the food menu.

RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nWhich of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nfood was luke warm.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe will be back.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWorth the trip from Manhattan.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI take all my NYC guests to VT's.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThe food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny. \n\n### Output:\n"
