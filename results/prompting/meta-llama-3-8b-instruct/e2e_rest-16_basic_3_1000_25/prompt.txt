b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE] expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL".\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.\nOutput:\n[("mussels", POSITIVE), ("dessert", POSITIVE), ("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe hot dogs are top notch, and they\'re Slamwich is amazing!\nOutput:\n[("hot dogs", POSITIVE), ("Slamwich", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nBEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSpreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.\nOutput:\n[("Spreads", POSITIVE), ("toppings", POSITIVE), ("Spreads", NEGATIVE), ("toppings", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOnce you step into Cosette, you\'re miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.\nOutput:\n[("Cosette", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.\nOutput:\n[("sangria", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOverall, excellent restaurant!\nOutput:\n[("restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nmy favorite place lol\nOutput:\n[("place", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOverall, not worth the money.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE), ("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were less than impressed.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.\nOutput:\n[("wine list", POSITIVE), ("meal", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\neveryone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWhen I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.\nOutput:\n[("bagels", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe will be back.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nLLOOVVE THIS PLACE.\nOutput:\n[("PLACE", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAlso very inexpensive.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE), ("halibut special", POSITIVE), ("steak", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\ngreat food, great wine list, great service in a great neighborhood...\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE), ("wine list", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE), ("neighborhood", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\n(The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!)\nOutput:\n[("asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nit was really good pizza.\nOutput:\n[("pizza", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe only downside... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.\nOutput:\n[("somosas", POSITIVE), ("chai", POSITIVE), ("chole", POSITIVE), ("dhosas", NEGATIVE), ("dhal", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI love it.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAt first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAll in all we\'re already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nFor the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan. \n\n### Output:\n'
