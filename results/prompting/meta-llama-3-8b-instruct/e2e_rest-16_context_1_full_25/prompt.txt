b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.\nOutput:\n[("stuff tilapia", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt\'s a small cute restaurant.\nOutput:\n[("restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nFood-awesome.\nOutput:\n[("Food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe had a very nice time.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.\nOutput:\n[("takeout", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nShe was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE), ("dishes", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.\nOutput:\n[("waiter", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMyagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.\nOutput:\n[("Myagi", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.\nOutput:\n[("Thai food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE), ("NULL", NEGATIVE), ("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMy six year old loved it.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nChennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.\nOutput:\n[("Chennai Garden", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nTheir bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a \'special\' bagel experience.\nOutput:\n[("bagels", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe had half/half pizza, mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza!\nOutput:\n[("half/half pizza", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nReliable, Fresh Sushi\nOutput:\n[("Sushi", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nFood was good not great not worth the wait or another visit\nOutput:\n[("Food", NEUTRAL), ("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSimply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...\nOutput:\n[("Chinese food", POSITIVE), ("Chinese food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.\nOutput:\n[("Casa La Femme", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\ntoo large for just two people but nothing was left.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEUTRAL), ("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nToo bad the food wasn\'t of the same heritage.\nOutput:\n[("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nBut, they were too big for the bun.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!\nOutput:\n[("terrace", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nUnique apppetizers.\nOutput:\n[("apppetizers", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nskip dessert.\nOutput:\n[("dessert", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWas surprisingly disappointed.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nI have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good. \n\n### Output:\n'
