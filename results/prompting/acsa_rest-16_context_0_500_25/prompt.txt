b"### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant. DRINKS#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the drinks, DRINKS#QUALITY refers to the quality of the drinks and DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of drinks and the variety of the drinks menu. FOOD#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the food, FOOD#QUALITY refers to the quality of the food and FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of food and the variety of the food menu.

RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nIf you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThey are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSingle Worst Restaurant in Manhattan\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThere's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService was wonderful;\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGreat atmoshere and worth every bit.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAlways good drinks and service is pretty good;\nOutput:\n[(DRINKS#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nTerrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE), (RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOh, and there's hookah.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nBut too far east!\nOutput:\n[(LOCATION#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nHis response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, NEGATIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIf you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\ndelicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE), (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe will be back.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.\nOutput:\n[(LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGreat Indian food\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nRaymond the bartender rocks!\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food was excellent as well as service, however, I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nA quintessential slice of NYC pizza.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nmy favorite place lol\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nWent on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great! \n\n### Output:\n"
