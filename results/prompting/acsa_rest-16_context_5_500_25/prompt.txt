b"### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant.

RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nWe waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.\nOutput:\n[(DRINKS#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE), (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don\xe2\x80\x99t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nthe only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish. \nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt's just average, just shredded, no seasoning on it.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food is good.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE), (FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, NEGATIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI definitely wouldn't go back.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOverall, excellent restaurant!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE), (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt's simply the best meal in NYC.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIf you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGood, fast service.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food however, is what one might expect.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nTruly the mark of an attentive waiter.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIndo Chinese food, pretty good...\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWhile the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nConsequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI will be back!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThey never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table. \n\n### Output:\n"
