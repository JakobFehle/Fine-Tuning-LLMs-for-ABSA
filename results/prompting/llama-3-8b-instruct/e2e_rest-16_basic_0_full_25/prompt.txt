b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE] expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL".\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nWhich of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!\nOutput:\n[("terrace", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.\nOutput:\n[("pear torte", POSITIVE), ("staff", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nfood was luke warm.\nOutput:\n[("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it.\nOutput:\n[("Cypriot restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe will be back.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.\nOutput:\n[("veal", POSITIVE), ("mushrooms", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI really loved the different and inovated touch that\'s the cheff gives to the food.\nOutput:\n[("cheff", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWorth the trip from Manhattan.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI take all my NYC guests to VT\'s.\nOutput:\n[("VT\'s", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nBeef noodle soup is good as well.\nOutput:\n[("Beef noodle soup", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAll the staff is absolutely professional!! \nOutput:\n[("staff", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy.\nOutput:\n[("Mizu", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food is authentic Italian - delicious!\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIf you go here, do it on his off-night.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOh, and I never write reviews--I just was so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word.\nOutput:\n[("place", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI thought this place was totally overrated.\nOutput:\n[("place", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOur teenage kids love it, too.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService is average.\nOutput:\n[("Service", NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nIt is terrific, as is the value.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE), ("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI think I\'ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow.\nOutput:\n[("meals", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.\nOutput:\n[("restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThey even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.\nOutput:\n[("caviar", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nDecent wine at reasonable prices.\nOutput:\n[("wine", NEUTRAL), ("wine", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThe food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny. \n\n### Output:\n'
