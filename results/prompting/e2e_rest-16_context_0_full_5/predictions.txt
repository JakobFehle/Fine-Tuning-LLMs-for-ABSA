The phrase "at times" is a modifier that does not change the sentiment polarity. The phrase "a good thing" is a phrase that reinforces the positive sentiment. The phrase "lets face it" is a phrase that is often used to express a sentiment, but in this case, it is not the target of the sentiment. Therefore, the opinion target phrase is "it\'s" (or "it").  ### END OF INPUT/OUTPUT EXAMPLES ###'
