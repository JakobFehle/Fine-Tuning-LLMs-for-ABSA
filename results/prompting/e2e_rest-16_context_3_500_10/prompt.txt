b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nService is average.\nOutput:\n[("Service", NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nI do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $400.00 where I am not swept off my feet.\nOutput:\n[("dinner", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nDumbfoundingly Poor\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.\nOutput:\n[("service", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGreat food, amazing service, this place is a class act.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE), ("place", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWent here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent.\nOutput:\n[("decor", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE), ("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.\nOutput:\n[("entree", NEGATIVE), ("entree", NEGATIVE), ("dessert", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI definitely wouldn\'t go back.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThey are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe place was nice and calm.\nOutput:\n[("place", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nFor the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan. \n\n### Output:\n'
