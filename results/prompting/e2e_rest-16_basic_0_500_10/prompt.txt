Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE] expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL".\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nIf you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.\nOutput:\n[("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThey are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSingle Worst Restaurant in Manhattan\nOutput:\n[("Restaurant", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThere\'s nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.\nOutput:\n[("sashimi amuse bouche", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService was wonderful;\nOutput:\n[("Service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGreat atmoshere and worth every bit.\nOutput:\n[("atmoshere", POSITIVE), ("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAlways good drinks and service is pretty good;\nOutput:\n[("drinks", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nTerrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.\nOutput:\n[("management", NEGATIVE), ("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOh, and there\'s hookah.\nOutput:\n[("hookah", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nWent on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great! \n\n### Output:\n'
