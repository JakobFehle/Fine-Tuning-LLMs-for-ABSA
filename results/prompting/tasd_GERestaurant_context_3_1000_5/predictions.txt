The aspect phrase for the AMBIENCE is "Lokal", which is a common German word for "location" or "restaurant". The aspect phrase for the SERVICE is "NULL", as the sentence does not explicitly mention the service, but the speaker\'s intention to come back implies a positive experience.  ### END OF INPUT/OUTPUT EXAMPLES'
