b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nBest meal in a long time!\nOutput:\n[("meal", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe left, never to return.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were then shooed inside.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we\'ve ever had!! \nOutput:\n[("baked clams octopus", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI heartily recommend.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nYou cannot go wrong with this place.\nOutput:\n[("place", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI recieved prompt service with a smile.\nOutput:\n[("service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nYou must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.\nOutput:\n[("crabmeat lasagna", POSITIVE), ("chocolate bread pudding", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nYou will not be disapointed at all.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nshort and sweet \xe2\x80\x93 seating is great:it\'s romantic,cozy and private.\nOutput:\n[("seating", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSave yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSo, if you\'re walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who\'s going to be seating you first...\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.\nOutput:\n[("Service", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe hot dogs are top notch, and they\'re Slamwich is amazing!\nOutput:\n[("hot dogs", POSITIVE), ("Slamwich", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nA beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night.\nOutput:\n[("Egyptian restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI must give it Yon out of Yon stars!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThere was a small wait, but shorter than I expected.\nOutput:\n[("wait", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.\nOutput:\n[("entree", NEGATIVE), ("entree", NEGATIVE), ("dessert", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nA weakness is the chicken in the salads.\nOutput:\n[("chicken in the salads", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.\nOutput:\n[("foods", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWill never be back.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWhen the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService is top notch.\nOutput:\n[("Service", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nFor the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan. \n\n### Output:\n'
