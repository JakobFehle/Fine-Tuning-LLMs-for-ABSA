b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.\nOutput:\n[("portions", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nthe turkey burgers are scary!\nOutput:\n[("turkey burgers", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).\nOutput:\n[("scallops", POSITIVE), ("mahi mahi (on saffron risotto", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAdmittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.\nOutput:\n[("open kitchen", POSITIVE), ("restaurant", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE), ("balance of herbs and tomatoes", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.\nOutput:\n[("restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food however, is what one might expect.\nOutput:\n[("food", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance.\nOutput:\n[("Sushi", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.\nOutput:\n[("service", POSITIVE), ("ambience", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.\nOutput:\n[("environment", NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\ncirspy crust margherita pizza\nOutput:\n[("margherita pizza", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.\nOutput:\n[("place", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe staff there is very attentive and down to earth.\nOutput:\n[("staff", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.\nOutput:\n[("meat", POSITIVE), ("sauces", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE), ("meal", POSITIVE), ("kimchi", POSITIVE), ("salad", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nEven though its good seafood, the prices are too high.\nOutput:\n[("seafood", POSITIVE), ("seafood", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.\nOutput:\n[("cheesecake", POSITIVE), ("pastries", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she\'s-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).\nOutput:\n[("wait staff", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.\nOutput:\n[("Red Eye", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu.\nOutput:\n[("Shabu-Shabu", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nBest Indian Restaurant in the City\nOutput:\n[("Indian Restaurant", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.\nOutput:\n[("lobster sandwich", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMy quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.\nOutput:\n[("quesadilla", NEGATIVE), ("quesadilla", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThere was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment. \nOutput:\n[("beer", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.\nOutput:\n[("Service", NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nbut when we looked at the menu, there weren\'t a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.\nOutput:\n[("menu", NEGATIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nServes really good sushi. \n\n### Output:\n'
