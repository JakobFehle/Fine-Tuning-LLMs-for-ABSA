b"### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant. DRINKS#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the drinks, DRINKS#QUALITY refers to the quality of the drinks and DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of drinks and the variety of the drinks menu. FOOD#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the food, FOOD#QUALITY refers to the quality of the food and FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of food and the variety of the food menu. LOCATION#GENERAL refers the the location of the restaurant. SERVICE#GENERAL includes ratings on the service in general, the attitude of the staff, waiting times or other services such as takeaway. RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, NEGATIVE), (FOOD#PRICES, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI go out to eat and like my courses, servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGreat place, great value.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (RESTAURANT#PRICES, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nMake sure you try this place as often as you can.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThank You Emilio.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nExcellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nlobster was good, nothing spectacular.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nI have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nA little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#PRICES, NEGATIVE), (RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE), (FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWarm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI recommend it!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt's a small cute restaurant.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nEverything was wonderful; food, drinks, staff, mileau.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (DRINKS#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nCan't wait wait for my next visit.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nDon't get me started on the margaritas, either.\nOutput:\n[(DRINKS#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe had a good time.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nRestaurant with a view\nOutput:\n[(LOCATION#GENERAL, NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nHis response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nYum! \n\n### Output:\n"
