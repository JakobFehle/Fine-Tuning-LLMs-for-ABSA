b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE] expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL".\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nThe reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe hot dogs are top notch, and they\'re Slamwich is amazing!\nOutput:\n[("hot dogs", POSITIVE), ("Slamwich", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nBEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSpreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.\nOutput:\n[("Spreads", POSITIVE), ("toppings", POSITIVE), ("Spreads", NEGATIVE), ("toppings", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nSushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance.\nOutput:\n[("Sushi", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe Yellowtail was particularly good as well.\nOutput:\n[("Yellowtail", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE), ("drinks", POSITIVE), ("atmosphere", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.\nOutput:\n[("waiter", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOverall, not worth the money.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE), ("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were less than impressed.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.\nOutput:\n[("wine list", POSITIVE), ("meal", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\neveryone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAs many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nWe will be back.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nLLOOVVE THIS PLACE.\nOutput:\n[("PLACE", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAlso very inexpensive.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE), ("halibut special", POSITIVE), ("steak", POSITIVE), ("service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.\nOutput:\n[("stuff tilapia", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\n(The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!)\nOutput:\n[("asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nit was really good pizza.\nOutput:\n[("pizza", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe only downside... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.\nOutput:\n[("sea urchin", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.\nOutput:\n[("jukebox", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!\nOutput:\n[("Casa La Femme", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nAll in all we\'re already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nSaul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn. \n\n### Output:\n'
