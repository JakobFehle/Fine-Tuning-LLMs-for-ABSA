b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment, aspect phrase) triples of a sentence by identifying all the aspect categories addressed with their corresponding phrases and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards each aspect. Return a list of triples, each containing three strings in parentheses. If an aspect is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its aspect category and its sentiment and assign the aspect phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS].\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant. DRINKS#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the drinks, DRINKS#QUALITY refers to the quality of the drinks and DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of drinks and the variety of the drinks menu. FOOD#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the food, FOOD#QUALITY refers to the quality of the food and FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of food and the variety of the food menu.

RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nBest meal in a long time!\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE, "meal")]\n\nInput:\nWe left, never to return.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, "NULL")]\n\nInput:\nWe were then shooed inside.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, "NULL")]\n\nInput:\nStepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE, "Casa La Femme")]\n\nInput:\nI heartily recommend.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE, "NULL")]\n\n### INPUT:\nThe food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny. \n\n### Output:\n'
