b"### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (aspect, sentiment) tuples within a sentence by determining all aspects and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards them. Return a list of tuples containing two strings in parentheses. Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following aspects: [AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS]. \n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE]. \n\nAMBIENCE#GENERAL refers to the atmosphere inside and outside the restaurant, the facilities and the general noise level in the restaurant. DRINKS#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the drinks, DRINKS#QUALITY refers to the quality of the drinks and DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of drinks and the variety of the drinks menu. FOOD#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of the food, FOOD#QUALITY refers to the quality of the food and FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS refers to the selection of food and the variety of the food menu.

RESTAURANT#GENERAL refers to general opinions about the restaurant, RESTAURANT#PRICES refers to the general pricing level of a restaurant visit and RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS includes miscellaneous opinions about the restaurant, without focus on the aspect categories already mentioned. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the aspect.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nI go out to eat and like my courses, servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink.\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIn any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI have been going back again and again.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThis place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe Yellowtail was particularly good as well.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE), (FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, NEUTRAL), (DRINKS#PRICES, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting, without it trying to be that.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nOur experience did not ever get any better.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIt is simply amazing.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nToons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nGross food \xe2\x80\x93 Wow-\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nService is not what you are coming here for...\nOutput:\n[(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nalso it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, NEUTRAL)]\n\nInput:\nThey have it all -- great price, food, and service.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE), (RESTAURANT#PRICES, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.\nOutput:\n[(DRINKS#QUALITY, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIf you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.\nOutput:\n[(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE), (FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.\nOutput:\n[(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nIndoor was very cozy and cute.\nOutput:\n[(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThey never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table. \n\n### Output:\n"
