Extract all (aspect, sentiment, aspect phrase) triples of a sentence by identifying all the addressed aspect categories (AMBIENCE#GENERAL, DRINKS#PRICES, DRINKS#QUALITY, DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS, FOOD#PRICES, FOOD#QUALITY, FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, LOCATION#GENERAL, SERVICE#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#GENERAL, RESTAURANT#PRICES, RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS) and their corresponding phrases and analyzing the sentiment [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE] expressed towards each aspect.
