b'### Instruction:\nYou are an advanced AI for text classification, specialized in aspect-based sentiment analysis for texts in English. Extract all (opinion target phrase, sentiment polarity) tuples of a sentence by identifying all sentiments expressed in the text and determining the target phrase towards which the sentiment expression is directed. Return a list of tuples, each containing two strings in parentheses. If an opinion target is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its sentiment polarity and assign the opinion target phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no sentiments are expressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.\n\n* Consider the following sentiment polarities: [POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, NEGATIVE].\n\nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.\n\nHere are some examples:\nInput:\nBest meal in a long time!\nOutput:\n[("meal", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe left, never to return.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nWe were then shooed inside.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", NEGATIVE)]\n\nInput:\nStepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York!\nOutput:\n[("Casa La Femme", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI heartily recommend.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nYou cannot go wrong with this place.\nOutput:\n[("place", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nI recieved prompt service with a smile.\nOutput:\n[("service", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nThe food tasted very good.\nOutput:\n[("food", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nYou will not be disapointed at all.\nOutput:\n[("NULL", POSITIVE)]\n\nInput:\nshort and sweet \xe2\x80\x93 seating is great:it\'s romantic,cozy and private.\nOutput:\n[("seating", POSITIVE)]\n\n### INPUT:\nThe food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny. \n\n### Output:\n'
