b'Lets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "The food is good.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a positive sentiment.

b'Lets do this step by step. We would like to extract all opinion-target-phrase-sentiment-tuples from the following sentence: "I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.". First, we identify the sentiment expressed in the sentence: The sentence expresses a negative sentiment. Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a negative sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "waitress".. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("waitress", NEGATIVE)]]. \nSince the sentence contains only one opinion-target-phrase, we return a list containing only this phrase-polarity-tuple: [("waitress", NEGATIVE)]]. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("waitress", NEGATIVE)]]. \nThe labels POSITIVE, NEUTRAL and NEGATIVE describe the positive, neutral or negative sentiment expressed towards the opinion target.'
