Extract all (aspect, sentiment, aspect phrase) triples of a sentence by identifying all the aspect categories addressed with their corresponding phrases and analyzing the sentiment expressed towards each aspect. Return a list of triples, each containing three strings in parentheses. If an aspect is implied but not explicitly stated, identify its aspect category and sentiment and assign the aspect phrase "NULL". Return an empty list if no aspects are addressed in the sentence. Return only the list, without any further comments or text.'
