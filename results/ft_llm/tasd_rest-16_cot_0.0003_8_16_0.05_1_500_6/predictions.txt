Next, we determine the sentiment expressed towards this aspect: The aspect SERVICE#GENERAL is mentioned negatively in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following aspect-sentiment-phrase-triple: [(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, "delivering food")]'
b'Lets do this step by step. We would like to extract all aspect-sentiment-phrase-triples from the following sentence: "The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).". First, we identify the aspect addressed in the sentence and its corresponding phrase: The aspect SERVICE#GENERAL is referenced with the phrase "waitress". Next, we determine the sentiment expressed towards this aspect: The aspect SERVICE#GENERAL is mentioned negatively in the text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following aspect-sentiment-phrase-triple: [(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, "waitress")]'
