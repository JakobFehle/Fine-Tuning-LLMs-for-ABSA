Then, we determine what the target of the sentiment expression is: In this case, a negative sentiment is expressed towards the phrase "service".. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuple: [("service", NEGATIVE)]]. \nWe do the same for the phrase "management", resulting in [("management", NEGATIVE)]]. \nThe final result thus consists of the following phrase-polarity-tuples: [("service", NEGATIVE), ("management", NEGATIVE)]]. \nWe return the list of phrase-polarity-tuples from the function, without any further comments or text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following list: [("service", NEGATIVE), ("management", NEGATIVE)]]. \nWe return this list from the function, without any further comments or text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following list: [("service", NEGATIVE), ("management", NEGATIVE)]]. \nWe return this list from the function, without any further comments or text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following list: [("service", NEGATIVE), ("management", NEGATIVE)]]. \nWe return this list from the function, without any further comments or text. \nThe final result thus consists of the following'
