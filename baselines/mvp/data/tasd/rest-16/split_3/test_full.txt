By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka !####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative')]

I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn 't have an upscale feel .####[('place', 'restaurant general', 'positive'), ('place', 'restaurant prices', 'negative'), ('chicken tikka masala', 'food prices', 'negative'), ('feel', 'ambience general', 'negative')]
