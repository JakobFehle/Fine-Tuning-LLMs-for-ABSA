Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed.	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The food was excellent as well as service, however, I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed.	FOOD#QUALITY#1	SERVICE#GENERAL#1	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
I do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $400.00 where I am not swept off my feet.	FOOD#PRICES#-1
We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $8 a piece.	DRINKS#PRICES#-1
Raymond the bartender rocks!	SERVICE#GENERAL#1
Pacifico is a great place to casually hang out.	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#1

BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE!	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1
Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance.	FOOD#QUALITY#1
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1
If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#-1
Great, original taste.	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#1
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.	FOOD#QUALITY#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#1	AMBIENCE#GENERAL#1
The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.	FOOD#QUALITY#1	DRINKS#QUALITY#0
Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
