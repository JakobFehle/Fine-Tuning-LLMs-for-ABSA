1356,Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance.,
1367,Great food!,
1369,"The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.",
1370,"If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.",

1425,What you are paying for is the environment and the name.,
1437,"All in all, the food was great (except for the dessserts).",
1438,The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.,
1476,"Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma. ",
1477,The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). ,
1478,"The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.",
1487,"Service not the friendliest to our ""large party""! ",
1490,"Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.",
1494,I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).,
1502,I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.,
1511,Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner,

1525,"As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.",

1578,Loved it,
1579,A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it.,
1581,"The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.",
1594,"The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)",
1595,"At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.",
1596,"On that scale, it's a world-beater.",
1599,"We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.",
1606,I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.,
1610,"No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!",
1615,I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.,
1621,Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan,
1624,The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.,
1633,"Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!",
1636,Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – ,

1641,"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??",
1645,"Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.",
1652,"His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.",
1658,"My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.",
1683,"Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.",
1691,I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.,
1703,"I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!",
1704,"The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).",
