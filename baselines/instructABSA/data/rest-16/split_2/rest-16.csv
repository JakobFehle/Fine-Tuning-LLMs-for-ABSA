1070,Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.,
1075,We were then shooed inside.,
1077,"We left, never to return.",
1078,"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.",

1091,"The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!",
1093,Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.,
1095,Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.,
1099,There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.,
1105,I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.,
1116,The wine list is extensive and impressive.,
1120,"Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.",

1341,"I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).",
1346,"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.",
1358,Very pleased,
1362,"One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!",
1365,Amazing food.,
1368,I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers.,
1375,"My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.",
1377,I was speechless by the horrible food.,
1383,Best In ALL of NYC,
1389,so delicious!!!!!!,
1390,Patsy's Pizza = true love,

1429,Vanison was good but not amazing.,
1439,"If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.",
1446,"Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!",

1457,We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.,
1460,We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.,

1486,"All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. ",
1495,"But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food",
1506,None was made so i hung up.,
1508,"My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.",
1513,The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!,
1540,"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!",
1548,"For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.",
1551,Terrible would be a compliment!,
1552,"The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.",
1564,Restaurant with a view,
1567,The main entree was also very good.,
1569,This place doesn't make any sense,
1571,"This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...",
1573,The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.,
1576,"The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.",
1582,"Our waitress wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.",
1583,"I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though.",
1591,"And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?",
1592,"A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).",
1593,"Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.",
1597,How is this palce still open?,
1608,"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing.",
1614,"The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.",
1635,"But nonetheless--great spot, great food.",
1639,"As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!",
1642,I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!,

1670,Don’t go to this place!,
1676,"When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.",
1678,Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.,
1684,Expensive,

91,"As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.",

184,"Rude service, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one",
186,I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.,
191,The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.,
220,"Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).",
227,"As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.",
237,It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.,

306,"The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.",
314,And where does Patis go wrong; no where. ,

321,Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.,
326,It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.,
328,The food is authentic Italian - delicious!,
332,The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.,
338,I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.,
346,We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.,
347,We were very disappointed.,
356,"First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.",
357,"Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.",
361,"For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... ",
371,I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.,

534,This was a great surprise.,
539,"We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!",
542,"Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!",

558,Fish is so very fresh.,
565,The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.,
571,Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.,
585,Wine list is extensive without being over-priced.,
590,"The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.",
594,"The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.",
605,"The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.",
607,I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!,

711,It's to die for!,
712,The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.,
729,Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!,
738,My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos.,
749,"Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.",
750,"The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.",
753,"Seriously, this place kicks ass.",
759,"It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.",
760,"The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.",

826,"But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.",
835,In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!,
839,"During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.",
840,I wish they would change back to what it was before.,
847,"Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.",
848,They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.,

1342,"When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.",
1350,"Great place, great value.",
1356,Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance.,
1367,Great food!,
1369,"The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.",
1370,"If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.",

1406,"Even though the place is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself.",
1408,AMAZING MY FAVORITE!!!,
1425,What you are paying for is the environment and the name.,
1437,"All in all, the food was great (except for the dessserts).",
1438,The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.,
1476,"Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma. ",
1477,The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). ,
1478,"The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.",
1487,"Service not the friendliest to our ""large party""! ",
1490,"Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.",
1494,I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).,
1502,I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.,
1511,Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner,
1518,Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.,

1525,"As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.",
1537,"The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.",
1562,Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.,
1577,Over all it was a very nice romantic place .,
1578,Loved it,
1579,A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it.,
1581,"The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.",
1594,"The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)",
1595,"At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.",
1596,"On that scale, it's a world-beater.",
1599,"We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.",
1606,I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.,
1610,"No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!",
1615,I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.,
1621,Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan,
1624,The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.,
1633,"Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!",
1636,Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – ,
1640,The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. ,
1641,"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??",
1645,"Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.",
1652,"His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.",
1658,"My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.",
1683,"Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.",
1691,I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.,
1703,"I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!",
1704,"The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).",
