Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!

The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol	FOOD#QUALITY#-1	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS#-1

Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.	FOOD#QUALITY#1
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1	RESTAURANT#PRICES#-1

As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.	FOOD#QUALITY#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1	FOOD#QUALITY#1

The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
