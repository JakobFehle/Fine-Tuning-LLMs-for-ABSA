1070,Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.,
1075,We were then shooed inside.,
1077,"We left, never to return.",
1078,"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.",

1091,"The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!",
1093,Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.,
1095,Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.,
1099,There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.,
1105,I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.,
1116,The wine list is extensive and impressive.,
1120,"Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.",

1341,"I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).",
1346,"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.",
1358,Very pleased,
1362,"One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!",
1365,Amazing food.,
1368,I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers.,
1375,"My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.",
1377,I was speechless by the horrible food.,
1383,Best In ALL of NYC,
1389,so delicious!!!!!!,
1390,Patsy's Pizza = true love,

1429,Vanison was good but not amazing.,
1439,"If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.",
1446,"Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!",

1457,We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.,
1460,We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.,

1486,"All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. ",
1495,"But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food",
1506,None was made so i hung up.,
1508,"My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.",
1513,The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!,
1540,"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!",
1548,"For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.",
1551,Terrible would be a compliment!,
1552,"The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.",
1564,Restaurant with a view,
1567,The main entree was also very good.,
1569,This place doesn't make any sense,
1571,"This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...",
1573,The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.,
1576,"The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.",
1582,"Our waitress wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.",
1583,"I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though.",
1591,"And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?",
1592,"A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).",
1593,"Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.",
1597,How is this palce still open?,
1608,"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing.",
1614,"The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.",
1635,"But nonetheless--great spot, great food.",
1639,"As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!",
1642,I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!,

1670,Don’t go to this place!,
1676,"When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.",
1678,Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.,
1684,Expensive,

91,"As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.",

184,"Rude service, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one",
186,I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.,
191,The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.,
220,"Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).",
227,"As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.",
237,It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.,

306,"The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.",
314,And where does Patis go wrong; no where. ,

321,Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.,
326,It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.,
328,The food is authentic Italian - delicious!,
332,The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.,
338,I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.,
346,We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.,
347,We were very disappointed.,
356,"First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.",
357,"Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.",
361,"For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... ",
371,I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.,

534,This was a great surprise.,
539,"We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!",
542,"Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!",

558,Fish is so very fresh.,
565,The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.,
571,Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.,
585,Wine list is extensive without being over-priced.,
590,"The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.",
594,"The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.",
605,"The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.",
607,I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!,

711,It's to die for!,
712,The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.,
729,Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!,
738,My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos.,
749,"Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.",
750,"The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.",
753,"Seriously, this place kicks ass.",
759,"It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.",
760,"The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.",

826,"But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.",
835,In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!,
839,"During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.",
840,I wish they would change back to what it was before.,
847,"Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.",
848,They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.,

1427,Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.,
1431,Dessert: pure disaster.,
1432,Just not good at all.,
1433,Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.,
1434,"I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.",
1436,"I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.",
1448,We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table.,
1451,The place is beautiful!,
1458,After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.,
1459,We asked for beverages and never received them.,
1471,I wish I COULD be refunded!,
1473,"At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.",
1489,Great Indian food,
1496,One of the BEST,
1500,Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC,
1501,Wretched and retching,
1503,For starters they delivered us someone else's order.,
1516,The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.,
1519,The nakgi-bokum was horrible.,
1520,Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted.,
1527,We were charged full price.,
1529,We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.,
1533,The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.,
1535,"Love this place, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go.",
1536,A quintessential slice of NYC pizza.,
1543,It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!,
1549,"Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.",
1558,I love it.,
1563,"The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.",
1570,Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.,
1584,"Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.",
1586,"This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.",
1589,Polite acknowledgement is out;,
1603,"I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.",
1604,"At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.",
1611,"This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.",
1613,The level of rudeness was preposterous.,
1625,Well...they can run but they can't hide.,
1628,The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!,
1646,"Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. ",
1648,"Maitre-D-""Eat and get out""",
1654,"If you go here, do it on his off-night.",
1657,I had the Lamb special which was perfect.,
1667,"I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.",
1669,Poor service and management,
1673,When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.,
1692,"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party.""",
1693,The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.,
1694,We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.,
1695,Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.,
1697,I generally like this place.,
