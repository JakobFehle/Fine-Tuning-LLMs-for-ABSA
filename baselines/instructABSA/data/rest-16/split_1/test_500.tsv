Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!

Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan	RESTAURANT#GENERAL#-1
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS#-1
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	SERVICE#GENERAL#-1
